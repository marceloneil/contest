Welcome to my mind after hours. A quick reminder for those who wish to pirate my code: __Dont.__
My code is <u>the worst</u>. As a bad as using your bricked blackberry as a butter knife.

I code to learn and improve my skills as a programmer. So if you wish to find amazing code you should probably type "tourist" into google. You'll probably find an archive of AMAZING code.

Nonetheless, take a look around, nobody's stopping you from hitting `ctrl + t` and `git clone ...`.

One last thing. Tabs over spaces :)
