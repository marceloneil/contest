# contest

Welcome to my mind after hours. A quick reminder for those who wish to pirate my code: __Dont.__
My code is <u>the worst</u>. It's a bad as using your bricked Blackberry to knife butter.

I program competitively improve my skills as a programmer... not to tutor others. If you do wish to discover AMAZING code, type "tourist" into google and *faint* in awe.

Nonetheless, take a look around, nobody's stopping you from hitting `ctrl + + alt + t` and `git clone git@github.com:curtischong/contest.git`.

One last thing. Tabs over spaces :)
